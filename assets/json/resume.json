  "Research Trajectory Note": [
    "Gap in Academic Training: I took a gap in my academic trajectory to care for my mother during an extended period of cancer treatment. This experience deepened my commitment to compassion, presence, and meaningful work. I returned to research with greater focus, resilience, and clarity of purpose.",
    "Reason Behind Field Changes: Each step in my academic path reflects the evolving questions I have pursued; moving from literature and meaning, to psychology and emotional communication, to computational modeling. These were deliberate expansions, chosen to extend my training and better equip me for the complexity of the questions I aim to answer. I believe this multidimensional background makes me a more informed and versatile researcher."
