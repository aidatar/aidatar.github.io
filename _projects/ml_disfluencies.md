We all pause, stumble, or restart when we speak — *uh*, *um*, *wait*, *I mean*… These disfluencies aren’t always just slips of the tongue; they can carry meaning and shape how conversations unfold. Yet for a long time they were treated as noise in language research. Interest is now growing, but most studies remain narrow, often monolingual. Because disfluencies are a universal feature of speech, we need a multilingual perspective. That’s the goal of this upcoming project with [Julian Hough](https://julianhough.github.io/) at the University of Swansea, where we’ll use the [DUEL](https://aclanthology.org/L16-1281/) corpus and architectures like [STIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6788) and deep_disfluency to explore how people process disfluencies across languages.

## Stay tuned!
