Disfluencies (uh, um, repetitions, interruptions) are often dismissed as noise in dialogue — but they are signals. This upcoming project with [Julian Hough](https://julianhough.github.io/) at the University of Swansea will explore multilingual disfluency processing using [DUEL](https://aclanthology.org/L16-1281/) corpus and architectures from [STIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6788) and deep_disfluency.
