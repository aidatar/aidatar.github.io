Disfluencies (uh, um, repetitions, interruptions) are often dismissed as noise in dialogue â€” but they are signals. This upcoming project with Julian Hough explores multilingual disfluency processing using datasets like DUEL (Dialogue Understanding via Explicit/Latent Disfluency Signals) and architectures from deep_disfluency
.
