During my master’s studies in February 2020, I worked on translating and adapting Prentky’s [J-SOAP-II (Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol-II)](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/202316.pdf) into Persian.

Although the project was archived due to the pandemic and my dissertation focus shifted to the survivors' perspective, I developed an interview package for male offenders and corresponded with Prof. Robert Prentky on cultural adaptation challenges and with Dr. Sue Righthand on female sex offenders.
