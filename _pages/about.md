Iâ€™m a doctoral researcher exploring how people and language models process subtle signals in communication, particularly disfluencies like *um* and *hmm* and how they interact with meaning. My work blends psychology, computational modeling, and NLP to understand language in context and improve AI systems for dialogue, mental health applications, and user-centered design.

I'm completing my Ph.D. in Informatics (Natural Language Processing) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. [Martin Corley](https://martincorley.org/) and Dr. [Patrick Sturt](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tINgWG4AAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral research is the first to examine written disfluencies and their relation to nonliteral meaning in a computational psycholinguistics framework. In my research, Iâ€™m not aiming to make language models disfluent or sarcastic, but to improve their understanding of psycholinguistic features like written disfluencies and nonliteral meaning.

My path into disfluency research began during my General Psychology dissertation at the University of Tabriz, supervised by Dr. [Mostafa Zarean](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F1SRyf8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jana Javakhishvili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VkFUS-wAAAAJ&hl=en). Interviewing psychotrauma survivors, I became interested in intentional disfluencies and the potential meaning behind these interruptions. That project was the first to compare cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in individuals with and without sexual traumatic experiences, and it continues to shape the way I approach communication in both human and machine contexts.
