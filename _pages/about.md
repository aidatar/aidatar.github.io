Iâ€™m a final-year doctoral researcher exploring how people and language models process subtle signals in communication, particularly **written disfluencies** like ***um*** and ***hmm*** and how they interact with meaning. My work blends experimental psycholinguistics (e.g., eye-tracking and cloze completion), computational modeling (masked and causal), and natural language processing (corpus analysis) to understand language in context and improve AI systems for conversation, mental health applications, and user-centered design.

I'm completing my Ph.D. in Informatics (Natural Language Processing) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. **[Martin Corley](https://martincorley.org/)** and Dr. **[Patrick Sturt](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tINgWG4AAAAJ&hl=en)**. My doctoral research is the first to examine written disfluencies and their relation to **nonliteral meaning** in a computational psycholinguistics framework. In my research, Iâ€™m not aiming to make language models disfluent or sarcastic, but to improve their understanding of psycholinguistic features like written disfluencies and nonliteral meaning.

My path into disfluency research began during my General Psychology dissertation at the University of Tabriz, supervised by Dr. **[Mostafa Zarean](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F1SRyf8AAAAJ&hl=en)** and Prof. **[Jana Javakhishvili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VkFUS-wAAAAJ&hl=en)**. Interviewing psychotrauma survivors, I became interested in intentional disfluencies and the potential meaning behind these interruptions. That project was the first empirical comparison of cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in individuals with and without sexual traumatic experiences, conducted in the Iranian context, and it continues to shape the way I approach communication in both human and machine contexts.
